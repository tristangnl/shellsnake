# shellsnake
a minimalistic snake game for the shell coded in c.
With this project, I wanted to practice using two-dimensional arrays.
I also learned how to use the ncurses library, which allows capturing user input continuously while the program is running.

## Versions

There are two versions:

- A **minimalistic** one, which is highly customizable -> **📁 Minimalistic**  
- The **second** one, where I've added some features and styles -> **📁 Upgraded**

### Commands

- **Arrows**: Move
- **Escape**: Exit
